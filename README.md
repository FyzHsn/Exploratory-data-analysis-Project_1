Exploratory-data-analysis-Project_1
===================================

This repository contains my solutions for the Exploratory Data Analysis course on coursera. I downloaded individual household electric power consumption data in an household with a one minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. We focus on the two particular days of 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. The data was derived by cloning and forking the repository: "https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1". 

We attach four png files as specified, meant to be an exploratory data analysis tool (and not for final communication) and the R code that creates the files.
